                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Prabhav. Thanks for checking out my site. I am going to be a high school freshman next year and intend to pursue an education and career in computer science. I am particularly interested in software engineering. Currently, I am working on an online course cs50 Intro to Computer Science by Harvard which focuses on C with some SQL. In the future, I plan to learn python before focusing on a specific path in computer science. Software engineering is a broad field so I would have the freedom to follow the path that interests me. In addition, the job outlook for software engineering is great.

                <h3>Skills and Achievements</h3>

                        <p>
                            In 8th grade, I received two academic excellence awards from my school. Such dedication is essential in academics and jobs. Furthermore, I joined the middle school cricket team as a 6th grader. In my 7th and 8th grade years I assisted in coaching the players and also captained one of the teams.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Keeping calm and patient in any circumstance is vital in cricket just like most team sports. After years of playing, I possess these traits in abundance and have valuable experiance as a leader and a teammate. These skills are essential in an occupations concerning software engineering. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is my opinion that given time and further learning, I would be ideal for a software engineering occupation. With my current skills and mindset, I feel that I am fully capable of pursuing an education and career in computer science.
